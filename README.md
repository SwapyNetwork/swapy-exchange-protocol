# Swapy Exchange Protocol
#### NOTE: The protocol was previously created on a private repository. Since the beginning, we have thought about open sourcing the protocol as the community has much to contribute to it as well as the protocol and the source code may be helpful to other projects too. As the protocol achieved a certain level of maturity we decided to move it to a public repository under Apache 2.0 License (without its history). We invite you all to join us in our dream of a world in which everyone has ACCESS TO CREDIT. The Swapy team is looking forward to your comments, issues, contributions, derivations, and so on.
